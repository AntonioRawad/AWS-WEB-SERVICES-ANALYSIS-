# AWS-WEB-SERVICES-ANALYSIS-


Project Name: Analyze AWS Services


Project Description:
This project aims to analyze AWS services in order to identify cost savings opportunities, improve performance and reliability, and enhance security.
Project Goals:
The goals of this project are to:
Identify cost savings opportunities by analyzing AWS pricing and usage data.
Improve performance and reliability by analyzing AWS service metrics and logs.
Enhance security by analyzing AWS security features and configurations.

Data set descriptions:
The dataset contains information about AWS services, including pricing, usage, metrics, and logs. The dataset is divided into three main categories:
Pricing data: This data includes the price of AWS services, as well as the discounts that are available.
Usage data: This data includes the amount of AWS services that have been used, as well as the time periods when they were used.
Metrics data: This data includes the performance and reliability metrics for AWS services.
Logs data: This data includes the logs for AWS services, which can be used to troubleshoot problems and identify security issues.
The dataset is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about AWS services. It can be used to identify cost savings opportunities, improve performance and reliability, and enhance security. The dataset can also be used to develop new applications and services that use AWS.
The dataset is available for download from the AWS website. It is a large dataset, so it may take some time to download. Once the dataset has been downloaded, it can be imported into a data analysis tool, such as a spreadsheet or a statistical software program.
The dataset can be used to answer a variety of questions, such as:
Which AWS services are the most expensive?
Which AWS services are the most popular?
Which AWS services are the most reliable?
Which AWS services are the most secure?
The dataset can also be used to develop new applications and services that use AWS. For example, you could develop an application that helps users to find the most cost-effective AWS services for their needs. Or, you could develop a service that helps users to troubleshoot problems with their AWS services.
The dataset is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about AWS services. It can be used to identify cost savings opportunities, improve performance and reliability, enhance security, and develop new applications and services.

AWS Services Used
The following AWS services will be used for the project:
Amazon S3: A service that provides object storage in the cloud. It can be used to store any type of data, including images, videos, and text files.
Amazon EC2: A service that provides compute power in the cloud. It can be used to run virtual machines that can be used to run applications and services.
Amazon RDS: A service that provides relational database service in the cloud. It can be used to run popular relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
Amazon DynamoDB: A service that provides NoSQL database service in the cloud. It can be used to run fast and scalable NoSQL databases.
Amazon CloudFront: A service that provides content delivery network (CDN) in the cloud. It can be used to deliver web content, such as images, videos, and text files, to users with low latency.
Amazon Lambda: A service that provides serverless computing in the cloud. It can be used to run code without having to provision or manage servers.
Amazon CloudWatch: A service that provides monitoring and management of AWS resources. It can be used to collect and analyze metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources.
Amazon CloudTrail: A service that provides auditing and logging of AWS API calls. It can be used to track who made API calls, when they were made, and what parameters were used.
Amazon Key Management Service (KMS): A service that provides encryption keys for AWS services. It can be used to encrypt data stored in AWS services.
Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM): A service that provides access control for AWS services. It can be used to control who has access to AWS resources and what they can do with them.







Project Deliverables:
The project will deliver the following deliverables:
Cost savings analysis report
Performance and reliability improvement report
Security enhancement report
Project Risks:
The following risks have been identified for the project:
Data quality issues
Technical challenges
Resource constraints
Project Mitigation Strategies:
The following mitigation strategies have been developed for the project risks:
Data quality issues will be mitigated by using a rigorous data cleaning and validation process.
Technical challenges will be mitigated by using a team of experienced engineers and data scientists.
Resource constraints will be mitigated by using a phased approach to the project and by leveraging cloud-based resources.



AWS Web Services Analysis Project Pseudo-Chart 
Start
Identify the problem that you want to solve with the data.
What do you want to learn from the data?
What are your goals for the analysis?
Answers:
I want to learn about the pricing structure of AWS services. I want to use this information to improve the marketing and sales efforts for AWS.
My goals for the analysis are to:
Understand the pricing structure of AWS services.
Identify trends in the pricing of AWS services.
Gain insights from the pricing of AWS services.
Step 1: Collect the data.
Where can you find the data?
The data can be found on Kaggle.
The data is available in CSV and JSON format.
There are no major data quality issues.
How will you collect the data?
I will collect the data myself by downloading the CSV and JSON files from Kaggle.
Step 2: Store the data.
Where will you store the data?
I will store the data in Amazon S3.
The data will be stored in CSV and JSON format.
How will you organize the data?
Will you create a data dictionary?
Yes, I will create a data dictionary to document the data.
The data dictionary will include the following information:
The name of each column.
The data type of each column.
A description of each column.
Step 3: Analyze the data.
What tools will you use to analyze the data?
I will use Python to analyze the data.
I will use the following Python libraries and tools:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
I will also use the following AWS services:
Amazon Redshift
Amazon SageMaker
What methods will you use to analyze the data?
Will you use descriptive statistics?
Yes, I will use descriptive statistics to describe the data.
I will use descriptive statistics to answer the following questions:
What are the most popular AWS services?
What are the average prices for AWS services?
What are the trends in the pricing of AWS services?
Will you use inferential statistics?
Yes, I will use inferential statistics to test hypotheses about the data.
I will use inferential statistics to answer the following questions:
Is there a relationship between the price of an AWS service and its popularity?
Does the price of an AWS service change over time?
Will you use machine learning algorithms?
Yes, I will use machine learning algorithms to predict future trends.
I will use machine learning algorithms to answer the following questions:
What are the future prices of AWS services?
Which AWS services are most likely to be used in the future?
Step 4: Visualize the data.

Seaborn
Step 5: Communicate your findings.
How will you communicate your findings to stakeholders?
I will create a presentation to communicate my findings to stakeholders.
The presentation will be in PowerPoint format.
Use Case
The use case for this project is to identify cost savings opportunities, improve the marketing and sales efforts for AWS, and gain insights from the pricing of AWS services.
We will use the data we collect to identify cost savings opportunities by comparing the prices of AWS services to those of similar services from other cloud providers. We will also use the data to identify trends in the pricing of AWS services. This information will be used to improve the marketing and sales efforts for AWS by making sure that AWS is competitive with other cloud providers. Finally, we will use the data to gain insights from the pricing of AWS services. This information will be used to improve the overall pricing structure of AWS services.
